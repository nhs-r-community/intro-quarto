## How *does* Quarto work?

::: incremental
- `r emo::ji("shrug")`
- I press `Render`, a document appears, and I believe that anything happening in between could be actual magic!
- `knitr` executes the code and converts `.qmd` to `.md`; **Pandoc** renders the `.md` file to the output format you want
- What do you think?

## Answers?

::: {.incremental}
1. `r emo::ji("shrug")` `r emo::ji("heavy_check_mark")`
2. ["I press knit, a document appears, and I believe that anything happening in between could be actual magic."](https://twitter.com/allison_horst/status/1070323369600442368?s=20) `r emo::ji("wizard")`)
3. `knitr` executes the code and converts `.Rmd` to `.md`; **Pandoc** renders the `.md` file to the output format you want. `r emo::ji("heavy_check_mark")`

## Metadata - YAML

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width='40%'}
*"YAML Ain't Markup Language"*

It's a language that isn't R or markdown!

``` yaml
---
key: value
---
```
:::

::: {.column width='60%'}

## Save output options in your YAML

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width='40%'}
Basic YAML that is generated from a template

``` yaml
---
title: "Report"
author: "Zoë Turner"
date: "01/08/2023"
format: html
---

```
:::

::: {.column width='60%'}
Can be extended for certain options

``` yaml
---
title: "Report"
author: "Zoë Turner"
date: "01/08/2023"
format: 
  html:
    toc: true
---
```

:::

## Your turn

In `my-report.qmd` do the following:

::: {.incremental}
- Add a table of contents (toc)
- Move it from the default right to the left
- Embed the source code (known as `code tools` in Quarto)
:::


See Quarto [online documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/reference/formats/html.html) for help

```{r}
countdown::countdown(
  minutes = 3,
  color_border = "#005EB8",
  color_text = "#005EB8",
  color_running_text = "white",
  color_running_background = "#005EB8",
  color_finished_text = "#005EB8",
  color_finished_background = "white",
  font_size = "2em",
  warn_when = 10,
  bottom = 1
)
```

## Answers

``` yaml
---
title: "Untitled"
format: 
  html:
    toc: true
    toc-location: left
    code-tools: true
---

```

::: {.notes}
Copying the code to MS Teams to share will lose the formatting!
:::

## Embed resources (or self-contained)

::: {.incremental}
- Adding `embed-resources: true` to the YAML removes a generated folder of the file name that includes supporting files.
- This makes it easier to share with others as only the html needs to be sent.
- Self contained from RMarkdown also works - Quarto is backwards compatible.

## Date formats in the YAML

Date formats in [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/reference/dates.html):

```markdown
date: today
date-format: "D MMMM YYYY"
```
## Dark theme

Adding a dark theme to a report is possible with the following YAML:

```markdown
format:
  html:
    theme:
      light: default
      dark: darkly  
```
## Time for a break! `r emo::ji("stopwatch")`
 
```{r}
countdown::countdown(minutes = 10)
```
