## Adding images using markdown

The NHS-R Community logo taken from the GitHub repository directly

``` markdown
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nhs-r-community/assets/main/logo/nhsr-logo.svg)
```

. . .

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nhs-r-community/assets/main/logo/nhsr-logo.svg)

## Adding images using html

``` markdown
<a href='https://nhsrcommunity.com/'><img src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nhs-r-community/assets/main/logo/nhsr-logo.svg' align="right" height="80" /></a>
```

. . .

<a alt="NHS-R Community's logo" href='https://nhsrcommunity.com/'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nhs-r-community/assets/main/logo/nhsr-logo.svg"/></a>

## Adding images using `{knitr}`

```{r}
#| echo: true
knitr::include_graphics("img/purrr_cat.png")
```

. . .

```{r}
#| eval: true
knitr::include_graphics("img/purrr_cat.png")
```

## Adding images using the Visual view in RStudio

The Visual editor is great for WSIWYG (what you see is what you get) but also really useful for those who prefer the Markdown coding as the wizards give prompts:

::: incremental
-   In the Visual view click on the picture image in the tool bar before `Format` and `Insert`
-   Browse to the image you need
-   Then go back to Source to look at what code is generated
:::

## Navigating folders

In markdown linking to an image in the same area as the .qmd file is straightforward, as is going to a subfolder

``` markdown
![](img/bakers_2.png)
```

. . .

A subfolder from the main root needs `../`

``` markdown
![](../images/bakers_3.png)
```

. . .

::: {.callout-note collapse="false" appearance="default" icon="true"}
## Useful things to know

-   When typing the names of the folder, pause and use Tab to give you options to choose and save typing
-   Putting the `/` after a folder will show what's in that folder
-   But not after the `../` code!
:::

## Let's try this together!

1.  Open `images_report/example_report.qmd
2.  In the source view we'll link to an image in the same folder
3.  Then link to an image in a subfolder
4.  Finishing with a link to an image in a subfolder from the main root

::: {.callout-tip collapse="false" appearance="default" icon="true"}
## Some helpful tips

-   Add `embed-resources: true` to the YAML to remove the generated folder
-   The code we are testing is on the previous slide...
:::

::: notes
Same folder ![](bakers_1.png) Sub folder ![](img/bakers_2.png) Folder from subfolder from the main root ![](../images/bakers_3.png)
:::

Note that autofills. To force a prompt to autofill use `tab`

Also if Global Options/RMarkdown/Show output inline for all R Markdown... is ticked the picture will automatically appear in the script. To remove untick but also requires a restart `Ctrl + Shift + F10`

## Seeing the image in the script

Using the drop down menu with a cog, found next to the blue arrow with `Render`

> Preview Images and Equations

will not be ticked, selecting this will allow Quarto to show the image in the report script.

## Alt text

**Alt**ernative **text** is predominately for people using screen readers to explain images but is very useful when images break:

. . .

File should be `baker_3.png`

``` markdown
![](img/bakers3.png){fig-alt="Three green fuzzy monsters in chef hats stand on top of one another, with the one on top pouring flour into a mixing bowl."}
```

. . .

Rendered image doesn't work but the text shows

![](img/bakers3.png){fig-alt="Three green fuzzy monsters in chef hats stand on top of one another, with the one on top pouring flour into a mixing bowl."}

## Alt text using Markdown

Between `{}` that comes after the link:

``` markdown
![](img/bakers_3.png){fig-alt="Three green fuzzy monsters in chef hats stand on top of one another, with the one on top pouring flour into a mixing bowl."}
```

. . .

![](img/bakers_3.png){fig-alt="Three green fuzzy monsters in chef hats stand on top of one another, with the one on top pouring flour into a mixing bowl."}

## Alt text using HTML

Within the \<\> and space between sections

``` markdown
<div id="bakeoff">
  <img src="img/bakers_3.png" alt="Alt text:Three green fuzzy monsters in chef hats stand on top of one another, with the one on top pouring flour into a mixing bowl.">
</div> 
```

. . .

::: {#bakeoff}
<img src="img/bakers_3.png" alt="Alt text:Three green fuzzy monsters in chef hats stand on top of one another, with the one on top pouring flour into a mixing bowl."/>
:::

## Alt text using `{knitr}`

Code used in R chunks

```{r}
#| echo: fenced
#| eval: false
#| fig-alt: "Three green fuzzy monsters in chef hats stand on top of one another, with the one on top pouring flour into a mixing bowl."

knitr::include_graphics("img/bakers_3.png")

```

. . .

```{r}
#| eval: true
#| fig-alt: "Three green fuzzy monsters in chef hats stand on top of one another, with the one on top pouring flour into a mixing bowl."

knitr::include_graphics("img/bakers_3.png")

```

## Resizing images

Markdown doesn't support resizing and html requires knowledge of a different language but using {knitr} and Quarto options:

```{r}
#| echo: fenced
#| out-width: "50%"

knitr::include_graphics("img/bakers_3.png")
```

. . .


```{r}
#| eval: true
#| out-width: "50%"

knitr::include_graphics("img/bakers_3.png")
```

## Centre images

And can change where the image appears:


```{r}
#| echo: fenced
#| out-width: "30%"
#| fig-align: center

knitr::include_graphics("img/bakers_3.png")
```

. . .


```{r}
#| eval: true
#| out-width: "30%"
#| fig-align: center

knitr::include_graphics("img/bakers_3.png")
```

## Hyperlinks in markdown

Using the `[]` for the words:

``` markdown

```
