## Breaking up long reports in HTML

::: {.incremental}
- Used to allow users to toggle between sections and breakup very long HTML.
- Cannot be used in reports that are static like Word or pdf.

## Tabsets rely upon on few features

As a reminder, in markdown there is a hierarchy of hashes for tabs

```markdown
# Country analysis
## Overview
## Covid cases
```

. . .

And Quarto specific code is denoted by `:::` at the start and end of code to be affected. 

For example 

```markdown
::: {.panel-tabset}
# Country analysis
## Overview
## Covid cases
:::
```

## Let's try this

First of all we'll install a GitHub package which changes RStudio to have an add in menu:

```{r}
#| echo: true

# install.packages("remotes")  # if not yet installed
remotes::install_github("matt-dray/quartostamp")
```

. . .

Then we'll highlight from `## Overview` to the very end and select `Insert Tabset` from the Addins menu (under Help) and Render

. . .

:::{.callout-important collapse=false appearance='default' icon=true}
## Note the level of headers
- {quartostamp} can be used with or without text
:::

## Styling tabs

It's possible to change the view of the tabs:

```markdown
::: {.panel-tabset .nav-pills}
# Country analysis
## Overview
## Covid cases
:::
```
