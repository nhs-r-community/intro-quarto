## Two views of the Quarto report

RStudio offers a code markdown view through `Source` or a WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get) view through `Visual`

. . .

`Visual` can be selected from the template wizard and the code:

```markdown
editor: visual
```

will appear in the YAML so the .qmd will always open in Visual mode. 

. . .

:::{.callout-tip collapse=false appearance='default' icon=true}
## YAML intellisense
- Start by typing `editor` in the YAML and there will be a prompt to finish the word
- Press tab or Return to finish.
- Tab again at the `:` prompt offers the options: `visual` or `source`

## Visual Markdown Editing

![](img/visual-editor-word.PNG){fig-alt="Screenshot of Visual Editor button, written out"}

## Set default to Visual Editor

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width='60%'}

![](img/visual-editor-default.PNG){fig-alt="Screenshot of Tools/Global Options/RMarkdown/Visual with option to make Editor view default"}
:::

::: {.column width='40%'}
This is an option that can be set with a Quarto template but also changed in Tools > Global Options > R Markdown > Visual tab

::::

## Have a go!

1. Change the title and then render.
1. Go to the bottom of the existing code and in Visual mode create a header `Introduction code` and add a small table.
1. Change the view to Source from Visual - what does the table look like in code?.
1. Click on the wheel icon next to Render and in that menu select Preview in `View Pane`.
1. Render the qmd.

::: notes
For Visual mode in Quarto:
Type / then return for the visual mode to get a short list of code like chunks and headers.

The table can be created through Insert menu or Table and it's the same.

Type in the Source code table to mess up the structure, go to Visual and show how this can be moved with a mouse, then back to Source and it will be neatened automatically.
