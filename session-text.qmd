## Markdown

Quarto reports support text and code with the text being `Markdown`

**Q**uarto **M**ark**d**own

`.qmd` file

## Headers

``` markdown
# HEADER 1

## HEADER 2

### HEADER 3

#### HEADER 4

##### HEADER 5

###### HEADER 6

```
. . .

::: {.callout-warning collapse="false" appearance="default" icon="true"}
## Optional caption (warning)

Make sure that there is a space between the hashes!


#Example no space!
:::

::: notes
Ask to copy and paste to a report as this won't render in presentation slides - 2 hashes means it's a new slide.

Also show the Visual mode in RStudio for headers

## Formatting Text

Text formatting uses [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)

::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
``` markdown
**Bold**
_Italic_
*Also Italic *
***Bold and italic***
```
:::

::: {.column width="60%"}
**Bold**\
*Italic*\
*Also Italic*\
***Bold and italic***
:::
:::

. . .

::: {.callout-caution collapse="false" appearance="default" icon="true"}
### Underlining is missing

Whilst underlining can be done using using html it's not accessible for everyone and can be confused with hyperlinks so is best avoided
:::

## Lists

Bullets can be created with `*` or `-` and numbers can be `1.` repeated

. . .

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width='40%'}
```markdown
- Patient (_Unique NHS Number_)
- Referral (_Not unique_)
* Contact (_Not unique_)
* Diagnoses (_Multiple entries_)

These data types occur in various places

1. Mental Health
1. Outpatients
1. GPs

```

## When lists don't work

:::{.callout-warning collapse=false appearance='default' icon=true}
### Spaces!
- A return space is needed to separate the list from preceding text
- Spaces between the bullet symbol and text are also required 
- Separating lines that are not in bullets can be done with two spaces at the end
:::

. . .

Copy this to `my-report.qmd` and correct the issues

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width='50%'}
```markdown
Check the spacing:
- This is right up against the text

-This is missing a space
*Also missing a space

These two lines
need to be separated using two space

```
:::

::: {.column width='50%'}

```{r}
countdown::countdown(
  minutes = 6,
  color_border = "#005EB8",
  color_text = "#005EB8",
  color_running_text = "white",
  color_running_background = "#005EB8",
  color_finished_text = "#005EB8",
  color_finished_background = "white",
  font_size = "2em",
  warn_when = 10,
  bottom = 1
